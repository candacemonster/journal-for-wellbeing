The past has a funny way of clinging to us — not just in memory, but in identity. Mistakes we’ve made, opportunities we missed, or versions of ourselves we’ve long outgrown can start to feel like permanent fixtures. But they’re not. They’re chapters — not the title of your story.

It’s easy to replay old moments, to wish you’d said something different or taken a different path. But growth doesn’t live in rewind. It lives in what you choose next.

Maybe you’re rebuilding after loss. Maybe you're starting over after a setback. Maybe you’re simply waking up to the realization that you want more — more clarity, more calm, more connection. Whatever brought you here, you’re allowed to leave the past where it is and build something new from where you stand now.

### 1. You’re not behind.  
There’s no universal timeline for healing, thriving, or becoming. You’re not late. You’re not broken. You’re here, and that’s enough to begin.

### 2. Forward isn’t always fast.  
Sometimes forward means resting. Sometimes it means quietly tending to your inner life while the world rushes on around you. Progress isn’t always visible — but it is still real.

### 3. The past can inform you, not define you.  
It can teach you. It can sharpen your discernment. But it doesn’t get to tell you who you are now unless you let it.

So if today you needed a reason to let go of something that’s been holding you back — let this be it. You are not the sum of your regrets. You are the author of everything still unwritten.
