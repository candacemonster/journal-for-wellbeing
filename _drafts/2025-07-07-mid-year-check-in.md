We often rush through the midpoint of the year—busily crossing things off, adding more. But July invites something quieter: reflection.

Find a moment. A morning with tea. An evening with fading light.

Ask yourself:
- What felt meaningful in the first half of the year?
- What drained me?
- Where did I surprise myself?
- What do I want to feel more of?

This isn’t about performance. It’s about presence.

📓 *Prompt to try:*  
*“At the beginning of the year, I thought ___. Now I feel ___. What do I need next?”*

Let your answers come gently. Mid-year isn’t a deadline—it’s a doorway.
