There’s something sacred about the places we write.

This week, we’d love to see yours. Whether it’s a sunlit nook, a messy desk, or a blanket on the grass—snap a photo and tag us using **#journalforwellbeing**.

We'll feature a few in next week’s post.

And if you’d rather describe than share a photo, here’s a prompt:
📓 *“Describe the space where you feel safe to be honest.”*

Journaling is often solitary, but it doesn’t have to be lonely. This is our quiet little corner of the world—and we’re glad you’re here.
