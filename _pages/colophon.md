## Colophon

**Journal for Wellbeing** is a static site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The base theme is [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) by WowThemes, customized for clarity, whitespace, and calm reading.

Typography uses Google Fonts:
- **Righteous** for headings
- **Merriweather** for body text

There’s no JavaScript framework. Just HTML, CSS, and a bit of Liquid.

Lightweight analytics may be enabled to understand what’s helpful (never personal). Some links may be affiliate, always disclosed.

No newsletter funnel. No pop-ups. Just a quiet place for journalers and thoughtful note-takers.
