    <h1>About Journal for Wellbeing</h1>

    <p><strong>Journal for Wellbeing</strong> is a quiet blog about the practice of journaling. It explores how writing things down — honestly, regularly, imperfectly — can help us listen inward and live with more intention.</p>

    <p>Posts are published without urgency. Topics include the psychology of journaling, reflective prompts, and thoughts on paper, memory, and mood. The goal isn’t to optimize — just to notice.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Transparency</h4>
    <p>This site uses basic analytics to understand what’s useful, and some pages contain ads or affiliate links (e.g., to Bookshop.org or eBay). These are selected with care and help cover maintenance costs. Nothing is paywalled or sponsored in disguise.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Who's behind this?</h4>
    <p>This project is maintained by someone who journals often and thinks slowly. There’s no personal brand, coaching offer, or productivity funnel — just an interest in the written word and what it reveals.</p>
