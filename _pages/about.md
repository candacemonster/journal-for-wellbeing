    <p class="lead">Journal for Wellbeing is a space for thoughtful journalers, reluctant diarists, and anyone seeking quiet clarity through the page.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Journal for Wellbeing</strong> is a quiet corner about putting things on paper—honestly, regularly, imperfectly. Not a system. Just a practice of pausing long enough to notice what’s actually here.</p>

    <p>Posts show up when they’re ready. No content calendar. You’ll find reflective prompts, tiny grounding practices, gentle notes on attention, mood, memory, and the occasional research thread—distilled without hype. The point isn’t to optimize; it’s to notice and stay in honest contact with yourself.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Why this exists</h4>
    <p>A few honest lines have kept me more <em>with</em> myself—through fatigue, health noise, anxiety loops, and the impulse to turn everything into a productivity project. This site just gathers what’s been quietly useful in case it helps you return to your own page.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Transparency</h4>
    <p>Lightweight, privacy-respecting analytics help me see what’s useful (no invasive tracking). Some outbound links may be affiliate (e.g. Bookshop.org, an occasional eBay find). They help cover hosting & domain. Nothing is paywalled. Nothing is secretly sponsored. If that ever changes, it will be labeled plainly.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Who’s behind it</h4>
    <p>It’s mostly one person—but the voice is more “fellow journaler” than “expert.” Posts might sometimes reflect conversations with others, quotes from books, or shared insights from the quiet practice of paying attention. No coaching funnel. No “10x” promise. Pens, pages, repetition. That’s it.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">If you’re new (optional starting points)</h4>

    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Colophon</h4>
    <p>Built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a>. Theme began as <a href="https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mediumish</a> (WowThemes) and was softened—fewer distractions, quieter palette. Hosted on GitHub Pages. Some GIFs will gradually be replaced where they slow pages.</p>

      <p>This project has no official “community” or loud social presence. If it appears elsewhere, this site is still the home. Quiet is intentional.</p>
