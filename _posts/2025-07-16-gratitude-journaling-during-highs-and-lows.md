When you live with chronic illness, you don’t always get clean slates or full capacity days. But you *can* build small moments of steadiness. Gratitude journaling—when done honestly—can be one of them. Not as a fix, not as a bypass. Just as a quiet way to say: *something held me today, even if the day was hard.*

### When You’re Low

There are days when asking “What am I grateful for?” feels like a joke. Instead, try prompts that meet your nervous system where it *actually is*:

- “One thing that didn’t completely suck today was…”  
- “I’m proud of myself for…”  
- “Today I showed up for myself by…”  
- “The smallest relief was…”  
- “A neutral thing I can name is…” (neutral counts when “positive” feels fake)

This is gritty gratitude. It doesn’t ask you to feel better. It just reminds you: *I’m still here. Still paying attention.*

---

### When You’re Doing Okay (or Even Good)

If clarity, calm, or joy shows up—amplify it. Not to cling, but to *mark it*:

- “I want to remember this moment because…”  
- “Right now I’m savoring…”  
- “I felt fully alive when…”  
- “My body feels ___ and I want to anchor that.”

These become emotional touchstones. Something you can return to on rougher days.

### Holding Two Truths

Practice naming what’s hard and what’s still holding you—together:

> *“Right now I feel __________ and __________. Both are valid.”*

Example: *“I feel exhausted and a little grateful. Both are true.”*

This gently rewires the binary stress response. Both/and builds capacity.

### A Low-Energy Micro Ritual (5 Minutes)

1. Three slow breaths (longer exhale)  
2. One feeling word (guess if needed)  
3. One honest line: “Today I…”  
4. One gratitude or grounded noticing: “Still, I noticed…”  
5. Optional: a small glimmer (cool air, dog sigh, text ping)

Stop there. That counts. This practice doesn’t demand pages—just frequency.

### Gentle Prompts to Rotate

- “Something small that supported me today was…”  
- “I almost missed noticing…”  
- “I softened for a second when…”  
- “A past version of me would be grateful I…”  
- “What feels fragile *and* worth appreciating is…”

No pressure to be poetic. Just name what’s real.

---

### Avoiding Toxic Positivity

You are not required to mine pain for meaning on command. Gratitude doesn’t erase struggle. When appreciation feels out of reach, start with neutral observation:

> *“Rain today. Body heavy. Still here.”*

That’s a bridge. Gratitude can wait. Presence comes first.

You don’t have to choose between honesty and gratitude. Let the page hold both. One line of truth + one small noticing is a complete entry. Over time, this repetition becomes a thread of safety, even on hard days.

Both can live here. *So can you.*
