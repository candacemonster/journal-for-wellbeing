Living with chronic illness or persistent fatigue means starting each day already in a deficit. Even neutral tasks feel elevation-grade. Identity can blur. Voice can feel distant.

Journaling does *not* have to become another performance metric. Think of it as a soft tether: a minimal gesture that says, *I’m still here inside this body.*

### Why It Helps (Even When Energy Is Fragile)
Micro writing can:
- Externalize symptoms or frustration (less looping internally)
- Offer a private valve for grief, anger, or guilt
- Catch tiny glimmers (a breeze, a dog’s sigh) before they vanish
- Surface patterns (pain spikes, emotional dips, post-exertion crash timing)
- Reinforce continuity of self: *my story persists, even slowed*

### Ultra-Low Effort Formats
Pick *one*. Stop before it strains.

- **One-line log:** “Heavy morning. Sat in sun 4 minutes—helped.”
- **Five word weather:** “Stiff, foggy, pulsing, flat, hopeful.”
- **Symptom pair:** One hard thing + one thing you did anyway.
- **Energy tag:** (E:) 20%, (Mind:) scattered, (Mood:) neutral.
- **Voice memo instead of pen:** Speak for 45 seconds; transcribe later (or never).
- **“If I had more energy…” list:** Desire without self-blame.
- **Grief + gratitude duo:** “Grieving lost stamina // grateful for warm tea.”

### Gentle Reframes
You’re not lazy; you’re load-managing a system under strain. Rest is *active care*, not absence of will. A single authentic line holds more value than a forced page.

### Micro Prompts (Use / Ignore)
- “Today my body is asking for…”
- “The hardest part was…”
- “I’m proud I still…”
- “One small kindness (to me / from me) was…”
- “I wish people understood…”
- “A sensation I can tolerate right now is…”

### 3-Minute “Fog Protocol”
1. Name one body sensation (“pressure behind eyes”).  
2. Name one feeling word (guess if unsure).  
3. One compassionate line to self (“Makes sense I’m depleted; pacing helped prevent a crash.”).  
Done.

### Tracking Without Overwhelm
Every few days glance back only to notice *patterns*, not to judge output. If entries shrink to a single word, that’s still data *and* presence.

### Optional Internal Companions
- Permission to begin imperfectly: *Start Where You Are* (/start-where-you-are/)
- Keeping it to just a few honest lines: *A Few Lines a Day* (/a-few-lines-a-day/)
- Creating a minimal sensory container (if helpful): *The Journaling Ritual* (/journaling-ritual/)
- Light science & why this matters: *The Science of Journaling* (/journaling-science-benefits/)

(Use only what actually supports you; skip the rest.)

### When You Can’t Write
Circle a preprinted mood word, underline a symptom scale, or place a single dot on the page for *“I checked in.”* That dot is still authorship.

Your fatigue doesn’t dilute your insight. Illness slows form; it doesn’t silence worth. One word, one line, one compassionate notation belongs wholly to you—and that is enough.

*Absolutely no wrong way to do this, especially on low capacity days.*
