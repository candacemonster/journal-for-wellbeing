You don’t have to be “ready.”

Not healed. Not organized. Not caught up.  
Not sitting in a sun-lit, plant-curated nook with the perfect linen notebook.

You can begin a journaling practice from the ordinary clutter of today.

Right here: the tightness behind your ribs, the tab you forgot to close, the thing you meant to say, the fatigue, the small flicker that still wants something. That’s raw material. Ink doesn’t ask for polish—it asks for contact.

Set a pen down. Date the page—or don’t.  
Write the first *present* thing you notice:  
*“Tired. Mild headache. Don’t want to start. Still here.”*  
That counts.

If ritual helps, I wrote about making a very simple one—candle, cup, breath—so the body learns *“we drop here now”* ([read it here]({{ site.baseurl }}/journaling-ritual/)).  
If you’d rather keep it tiny, a few honest lines a day are enough ([that note is here]({{ site.baseurl }}/a-few-lines-a-day/)).

You are not a project to optimize.  
You are a person making a quiet mark that says: *I existed in this moment and paid attention.*

Start exactly where you are.

Then—when you arrive tomorrow—you’ll already be someone who writes, even if it’s only three true lines.

A page doesn’t need perfection.  
It needs presence.

*If you want a gentle next step, wander over to the little ritual or the “few lines” note above.*
