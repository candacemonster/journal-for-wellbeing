You don’t need to be healed.

You don’t need to be organized.

You don’t need to have your routine perfectly planned or your space perfectly set up.

You don’t need the ideal conditions.

You just need the truth of where you are — right now.

## Begin with what’s here:

- The ache in your chest  
- The undone things  
- The swirling thoughts  
- The moment you have  
- The pen in your hand

You can write from that place. Speak from that place. Breathe from that place.

We are not projects to be optimized. We are people trying to find ourselves in the mess.

So come to the page as you are.

Start where you are.
