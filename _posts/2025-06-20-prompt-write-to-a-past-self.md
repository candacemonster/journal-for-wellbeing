There’s a version of you who’s lived through something difficult. Maybe she still lives inside you. Maybe he’s long gone. Maybe they visit in dreams or on long drives.

This prompt is an invitation to meet them again — with softness.

## Prompt

Choose a version of your past self that you carry strong feelings about. Write them a letter. Not to correct or scold. Simply to connect.

You might begin with:

+ “I remember how lonely it was during…”
+ “You didn’t deserve the silence you received.”
+ “I see now how hard you were trying.”

Give this self whatever you wish you’d received then: acknowledgment, understanding, kindness, even just someone to listen.

You’re not rewriting the past. You’re tending to it.

Sometimes the most profound healing comes not from advice — but from presence.
