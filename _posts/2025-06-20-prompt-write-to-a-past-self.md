There’s a version of you who went through something hard.  
Maybe she still sits in your chest on quiet afternoons.  
Maybe he only shows up when you’re tired.  
Maybe they drift through old songs or long drives.

**This prompt is an invitation—not to edit their story, but to witness it.**

### Why This Heals

Research in self-compassion and narrative therapy (see Dr. Kristin Neff, Dr. Pennebaker) shows that simply *witnessing* and naming past pain can relieve shame, soften old wounds, and restore self-trust.  
You’re not rewriting the past.  
You’re integrating it—telling your earlier self: “You mattered then. You still matter.”

### The Prompt (Simple)

Pick a past self you still feel protective, ashamed, tender, or angry about.  
Write them a letter.

No fixing. No *“you should have.”* Just presence.

#### Possible Opening Lines

- “I remember how lonely it felt when…”  
- “You didn’t deserve how silent everyone was.”  
- “I see now how hard you were trying.”  
- “You were never the problem.”  
- “No one told you it was okay to feel that.”  

---

### Guidance

- Give that self what was missing: *naming, warmth, a steady voice that doesn’t leave.*
- If advice wants to rush in, slow it down. 
- Presence heals wounds that solutions alone cannot.
- If tears come, or if you need to stop, know that honoring the feeling *is* progress.

#### How to Close

- “I’m here now.”  
- “You weren’t wrong to need more.”  
- Or your own true line, written gently.

---

### Why It Matters

Integrating old selves makes you less likely to turn away from pain in the present or future.  
Attunement is how we grow self-trust.

If you’re stirred up: pause, breathe, come back tomorrow if you need to.  
The act of meeting them at all is enough.

**What would you say to a younger you—without judgment, just presence? If you like, share a line or keep it private as a gesture of self-kindness.**
