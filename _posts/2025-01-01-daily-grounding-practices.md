You don’t always have space for a full journaling session. Sometimes you just need to *land*—one notch lower in tension, one notch higher in presence. These micro grounding practices are deliberately small. Choose one. Let it be enough.

---

### How to Use This Page
Skim. Pick one that feels *available*, not ideal. Do it for 30–120 seconds. Stop. (You can journal a few lines after—but that’s optional.)

---

### 1. 5–4–3–2–1 (Ultra Simple)  
Name **5** things you see, **4** you can touch, **3** you hear, **2** you can smell, **1** you can taste (or would like to). If numbering feels like work, just list a few sense impressions.

### 2. Single Sensation Anchor  
Place one palm over heart or sternum. Feel warmth + movement for 5 slow breaths. Note one word: *“Here.”*

### 3. Temperature Shift  
Hold something cool (a chilled glass, water bottle) or warm (a mug). Notice how your body responds. One line in your journal: “Warmth helped” or “Cold cleared fuzz.”

### 4. Micro Body Scan (30 Seconds)  
Crown → jaw → shoulders → belly → hands. At each point: silently name tension / release. End with one exhale longer than the inhale.

### 5. Exhale Lengthening  
Inhale gently for a count of 4, exhale for 6 or 7. Repeat 6–8 cycles. (Longer exhale signals “safe enough.”)

### 6. Five Word Weather  
Write (or say) 5 single words for your internal landscape: *foggy / tight / hopeful / tender / hungry.* That’s a valid entry.  
*Want to keep entries tiny? See* [A Few Lines a Day]({{ site.baseurl }}/a-few-lines-a-day/).

### 7. Object Noticing  
Pick one ordinary object in sight. Describe it with 3 sensory adjectives. End with: “I was here noticing this.”

### 8. Support Point Check  
Notice everywhere the chair / floor supports you. Silently: “Supported at… (heels, thighs, back).” Let shoulders drop one millimeter.

### 9. Sound Horizon  
Name the farthest sound you can hear. Then the closest. Then silence between. (Presence triangulation.)

### 10. Future Self Postcard (60 Seconds)  
Write two present-tense lines addressed to a future you later today:  
“We made it to afternoon. Breathing eased a little.”  
Fold page metaphorically—revisit tonight.

### 11. Tension / Kindness Pair  
“I notice ___ tension.” → “Offering ___ kindness.”  
Example: *“Jaw tight.” → “Unclench + soften tongue.”*

### 12. Glimmer Catch  
Note one tiny neutral-to-pleasant stimulus (pattern of shadow, dog’s sigh, breeze). Give it a full breath of attention.  
Journal: “Glimmer = ___.”

---

### Linking the Practice to Writing (Optional)

If you have even *one* spoon left, convert the practice into a micro entry:
- *From #6:* “Word weather: foggy, restless, hopeful, hungry, quiet.”
- *From #3:* “Warm mug grounded me; anxiety 7→5.”
- *From #12:* “Glimmer: leaf shadow moving—2 breaths.”

That counts as journaling.

You don’t have to do all of these.  
One practiced regularly beats ten admired.  
Pick what meets *today’s* capacity.  
That is enough.
