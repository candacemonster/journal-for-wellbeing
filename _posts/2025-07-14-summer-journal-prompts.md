Summer rushes in with long light and busy intentions. These prompts are a counterweight: gentle invitations to slow down and notice what’s actually here. You don’t need full pages—three honest lines count.

### Seven Soft Summer Prompts

**1. What does peace feel like in my body right now?**  
Describe its texture, temperature, or location—even if it’s barely there.

**2. What summer moment felt like a small kind of healing?**  
Rebuild it with your senses: the light, the air, the quiet.

**3. Where am I allowed to soften?**  
A muscle group? A boundary? A self-imposed expectation?

**4. What would an unplanned, slow summer day look like?**  
Not a goal list—just the shape of ease.

**5. What have I overlooked that quietly brings me joy?**  
Name it. Return to it once this week.

**6. What am I carrying that July (or this season) doesn’t actually require?**  
List gently. Circle one thing you can set down today.

**7. What small rhythm is keeping me tethered?**  
A stretch, a song, a few lines on the page—how might I honor it more intentionally?

Use these scattered or in sequence—morning pages, twilight pause, one prompt during lunch. If beginning feels stiff, the reminder to start messy lives [here](/start-where-you-are/). Prefer tiny entries? That note is [here](/a-few-lines-a-day/). Need a soft ritual scaffold? Try [this one](/journaling-ritual/).

These are not assignments. Just gentle doorways. Walk through whichever opens.

(Share if you like—#journalforwellbeing—or keep them entirely your own.)
