Summer rushes in with long light and busy intentions. These prompts are a counter-weight: small invitations to slow down and be with what’s actually here. You don’t need full pages—three honest lines count.

### 7 Soft Summer Prompts

**1. What does peace feel like in my body right now?**  
Name its texture, temperature, pace—even if it’s faint.

**2. What summer moment felt like a small kind of healing?**  
Rebuild it with senses: light, air, sound, movement, stillness.

**3. Where am I allowed to soften?**  
A muscle group, a boundary, a daily expectation?

**4. What would an unplanned slow summer day look like?**  
No goals. Just the shape of ease.

**5. What have I overlooked that quietly brings me joy?**  
Name it. Plan one tiny return.

**6. What am I carrying that July (this season) does not actually require?**  
List it. Circle one item you can set down—today.

**7. Which small rhythm (morning stretch, evening walk, a few lines) is keeping me tethered?**  
How can I honor it more intentionally this week?

Use them scattered or in sequence—morning pages, twilight pause, a single prompt on a lunch break. If starting at all feels clunky, the “begin messy” reminder is [here](/start-where-you-are/). If you’d rather keep entries to a few true lines, that note lives [here](/a-few-lines-a-day/). When a little structure helps you settle, there’s a simple ritual mapped [here](/journaling-ritual/).

These are not tasks. Just doorways. Walk through the ones that open.

(Share if you like—#journalforwellbeing—or keep them entirely your own.)
