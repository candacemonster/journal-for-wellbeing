## ðŸŒ¿ 7 Summer Prompts

1. **What does peace feel like in my body right now?**  
   Can I name its shape, its temperature, its pace?

2. **What summer moment felt like a small kind of healing?**  
   Describe it with your senses: the light, the air, the sound, the stillness.

3. **Where am I allowed to soften?**  
   What part of my day or self no longer needs to be held so tightly?

4. **What would a slow summer day look like if I planned nothing?**  
   No goals. Just presence. Let yourself imagine it.

5. **What have I overlooked in the rush that actually brings me quiet joy?**  
   Return to it â€” in memory or in practice.

These are not tasks. They are invitations. Use them however you like â€” with tea, with bare feet in the grass, with a notebook open beside the window.
