Sometimes the quietest parts of ourselves are the ones that need our attention most.

This weekend, carve out just five minutes — no expectations, no pressure to make sense of it all — and listen inward.

## Prompt:

**“What part of me wants to be heard right now?”**

Let your pen follow the voice that answers.  
It might whisper. It might ramble. It might not make much sense at first.

That’s okay.

You’re not trying to solve anything. You’re just offering space.

Even a few lines can create a shift — from internal noise to presence.

Let the page hold what’s too soft to say aloud.

*Return to this question anytime you feel disconnected from yourself. It's always a place to begin.*
