Sometimes the thing we most need to say is the one we’ve been quietly avoiding.

Take five minutes. Unrushed. No pressure to solve anything. Just a page, a breath, and a little space to listen inward.

**Prompt:**  
*“What have I not let myself say out loud?”*  
or  
*“What have I been feeling but holding back?”*

Let whatever surfaces be enough—tiredness, frustration, uncertainty, hope. Don’t try to clean it up or explain it. Write a few lines just as it is.

You can write as if you’re speaking to that feeling—“You’ve been carrying this for a while.” Or from it—“I’m exhausted and need a break.” Either way is fine.

If nothing comes at first, write: *“I’m listening.”* Keep the pen moving. Even that shows presence.

No fixing. No conclusions. Just honesty.

If starting messy feels hard, [this note](/start-where-you-are/) might help. If keeping it short helps you return tomorrow, [this one](/a-few-lines-a-day/) is for you.

Close the notebook when something in you feels named—even if it’s only a fragment.

You listened. That’s enough for today.
