Sometimes the quietest part is the one carrying the most.

Take five unhurried minutes. No goal. No need to “process.” Just a page and a little breath.

**Prompt:** *“What part of me wants to be heard right now?”*

Let whatever answers speak in its own texture:
- A tired voice that just wants rest  
- A sharp edge that’s been holding everything together  
- A small, unsure feeling that thought it had to stay quiet  

Write *as* it or *to* it. Spelling, grammar, coherence—all optional. If nothing comes, write “I’m listening” until a thread appears.

You’re not solving. You’re offering space. A few plain lines can shift the inner climate from static to presence.

If you need permission to start messy, that reminder is [here](/start-where-you-are/). If keeping it tiny helps you return tomorrow, the “few lines” note is [here](/a-few-lines-a-day/).

Let the page hold what’s too soft (or tangled) to say aloud. Close the notebook when the voice feels acknowledged—even if it’s mid-sentence.

Return to this question whenever you feel blurred or disconnected. It’s always a place to begin.
