Sometimes the thing we most need to say is the one we’ve been quietly avoiding.

Take five minutes. Unrushed. No pressure to solve anything. Just a page, a breath, and a little space to listen inward.

### Why Listening Inward Matters

Naming the truth of a feeling—even without fixing or changing it—reduces the grip of shame, rumination, or invisible overwhelm.  
Dr. Dan Siegel calls this “name it to tame it”: when we put words to an experience, the brain’s emotional reactivity decreases and self-trust grows.  
Listening first (before leaping to solution) is a skill—even a kindness—we can give ourselves.

### The Prompt

**Ask:**  
*“What have I not let myself say out loud?”*  
or  
*“What have I been feeling but holding back?”*

Let whatever surfaces be enough—tiredness, frustration, uncertainty, hope. Don’t try to clean it up or explain it away. Write a few lines just as it arrives.

### Ways to Write

- Write as if you’re speaking to that feeling:  
  “You’ve been carrying this for a while. I’m here now.”
- Or, write *from* it:  
  “I’m exhausted and need a break.”  
Either way, presence counts more than polish.

If nothing comes at first, write: *“I’m listening.”*  
Keep the pen (or cursor) moving. Even that is a form of presence.

No fixing. No conclusions. Just honesty.  
If you need permission to start in the mess, [this note](/start-where-you-are/) helps.  
Prefer brevity? [A Few Lines That Change Everything](/a-few-lines-a-day/) might be right for you.

Close the notebook or note when something in you feels named—even if it’s only a fragment.

You listened. That’s enough for today.

**What wants to be heard in you—right now? If you care to share, a line or two is always welcome (but never required).**
