Gratitude journaling isn’t just for your best days. It’s a tool that helps you **hold space for both light and dark** — without forcing a silver lining.

## Why Gratitude Journaling Isn’t Just for “Good Days”

Gratitude isn't about ignoring pain or slapping on toxic positivity. It's about making room for all your feelings — the messy, the mundane, and the meaningful — while still finding something solid to stand on.

When you're emotionally overwhelmed, journaling can be a lifeline. Even one line of truth can ground you.

## Journaling Through the Lows

On hard days, the prompt *“What are you grateful for?”* might feel impossible. Try reframing:

- “One thing that didn’t suck today was…”
- “I’m proud of myself for…”
- “Today, I showed up for myself by…”

This kind of gentle, gritty gratitude reminds you: even in the storm, you're still here.

## Journaling Through the Highs

When you’re riding a wave of peace, love, or clarity — amplify it.

Try:

- “I want to remember this moment because…”
- “I felt fully alive when…”
- “Something I’m savoring right now is…”

Capture it. Cement it. These moments become emotional touchstones you can return to.

## Holding Two Truths at Once

This prompt helps balance complexity:

> “Right now, I’m feeling both __________ and __________. And both are valid.”

Example:
> *Right now, I’m feeling both deeply tired and incredibly grateful. And both are valid.*

Let that sentence live in your journal for a week. Watch what unfolds.

## A 5-Minute Gratitude Ritual

If you’re short on time or energy, try this:

1. Take 3 deep breaths  
2. Name one feeling (no judgment)  
3. Write one sentence of gratitude  
4. Optional: Add a “glimmer” — a tiny moment of peace or beauty

That’s it. Small steps count.
