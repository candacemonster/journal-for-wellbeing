Gratitude journaling isn’t a highlight reel. It’s a way to **stand on something steady while still telling the truth**. No forced silver linings; no pretending. Just: *Both are here, and I’m meeting them.*

### When You’re Low  
On hard days “What am I grateful for?” can feel accusatory. Reframe it so your nervous system doesn’t bolt:

- “One thing that didn’t completely suck today was …”
- “I’m proud of myself for …”
- “Today I showed up for myself by …”
- “The smallest relief was …”
- “A neutral thing I can name is …” (neutral counts when positive feels fake)

This is gritty gratitude: evidence you’re still here, still participating.

### When You’re High  
When peace, clarity, tenderness, or joy visits—*amplify it deliberately*:

- “I want to remember this moment because …”
- “I felt fully alive when …”
- “Right now I’m savoring …”
- “My body feels … and I want to anchor that.”

You’re creating emotional touchstones your future, wobblier self can return to.

### Holding Two Truths  
Use a both/and line daily for a week:

> *“Right now I feel __________ and __________. Both are valid.”*

Example: *“Right now I feel deeply tired and quietly grateful. Both are valid.”*  
This trains your emotional system out of binary thinking.

### A 5-Minute Micro Ritual (Low Energy Friendly)
1. Three slow breaths (longer exhale).  
2. Name one feeling (guess if unsure).  
3. One sentence of honest reality (“My chest is tight; I kept going anyway.”)  
4. One sentence of gratitude or grounded noticing (“The dog leaned on me; that helped.”)  
5. Optional “glimmer”: a tiny flicker you want to keep (sun on the mug, cool air, a text).

Stop. Close. That **counts**. Frequency > length.

### Prompts to Rotate
- “Something small that supported me today was …”
- “I almost missed noticing …”
- “I softened for a second when …”
- “A past me would be grateful I …”
- “What feels fragile *and* worth appreciating is …”

### Avoiding Toxic Positivity
You are not required to convert pain into a lesson mid-feeling. If gratitude feels impossible, anchor in **neutral observation** first (“Rain today. Body heavy. Still here.”). Neutral is a bridge to softer appreciation later.

You don’t have to choose between gratitude and honesty. Let the page hold both. One line of truth + one line of appreciation or neutrality is still a legitimate practice. Repetition slowly rewires how your system meets extremes.

*Both can live here. You can, too.*
