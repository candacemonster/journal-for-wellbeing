Not every day has room for long journaling sessions. Sometimes what we most need is to *land*, right where we are—one notch lower in tension, one notch higher in presence.  
The following micro grounding practices are deliberately small. Each can help you shift from overwhelm to a moment of "enough."  
**Science shows** that even a few conscious breaths can calm your nervous system and support emotional balance (see: Dr. Stephen Porges’ polyvagal theory).

Pick one practice. Give yourself permission to let it be enough.  
_You can always journal a few lines after, but that's always optional._

### How to Use This Page

**Skim and choose:** What feels *available* right now—not ideal, just possible. Try it for 30–120 seconds. Stop. (If you want, jot down a few lines about the experience.)

---

## 1. 5–4–3–2–1 (Ultra Simple)  
Name **5** things you see, **4** you can touch, **3** you hear, **2** you can smell, **1** you can taste (or would like to).  
_This practice anchors you in the “now.” Even just listing 2 or 3 senses will shift your mind from spinning to noticing._

## 2. Single Sensation Anchor  
Place one palm over your heart or sternum.  
Notice the warmth and subtle movement for 5 slow breaths.  
Write one word that describes the feeling: *“Here.”*  
**Why it works:** Contact and breath signals “safe” to your body.

## 3. Temperature Shift  
Hold something cool (ice, water bottle) or warm (mug, blanket).  
Notice how your body responds.  
One line in your journal: “Warmth helped” or “Cold cleared fuzz.”

## 4. Micro Body Scan (30 Seconds)  
Crown → jaw → shoulders → belly → hands.  
At each point: silently note “tense” or “release.” End with one long, slow exhale.  
_Structures awareness and releases built-up tension._

## 5. Exhale Lengthening  
Inhale gently to a count of 4, exhale for 6 or 7. Repeat six to eight cycles.  
(Longer exhales activate your body’s “rest & digest” mode.)

## 6. Five Word Weather  
Write or say five single words for your internal weather: _foggy, tight, hopeful, tender, hungry._  
That counts as journaling.

## 7. Object Noticing  
Pick one ordinary object in your space.  
Describe it with three sensory adjectives. End with: “I was here noticing this.”  
(*e.g., “Mug: cool, ceramic, blue. I was here noticing this.”*)

## 8. Support Point Check  
Notice every place the chair/floor supports you. Silently, label each: “Supported at… (heels, thighs, back).”  
Let your shoulders drop, even just a millimeter.

## 9. Sound Horizon  
Name the farthest-away sound, then the closest. Listen for silence in between.  
(“Presence triangulation”—it brings you *here*.)

## 10. Future Self Postcard (60 Seconds)  
Write two present-tense lines addressed to your future self later today:  
“We made it to afternoon. Breathing eased a little.”  
(Fold your journal metaphorically—revisit tonight.)

## 11. Tension / Kindness Pair  
“I notice ___ tension.” → “Offering ___ kindness.”  
Example: “Jaw tight.” → “Unclench, soften tongue.”

## 12. Glimmer Catch  
Notice one tiny neutral-or-pleasant detail: pattern of shadow, dog’s sigh, a breeze. Give it a full breath of attention.  
Journal: “Glimmer = ___.”

## Why Grounding Works

A consistent grounding practice literally rewires the nervous system for calm and self-trust ([see The Science of Journaling]({{ site.baseurl }}/journaling-science-benefits/)).  
Even one mindful pause can make returning to yourself easier tomorrow.  
**“One practiced regularly beats ten admired. Pick what meets today’s capacity. That is enough.”**

## Linking the Practice to Writing

If you have even *one* spoon left, try a micro-entry based on your favorite practice:  
- “Word weather: foggy, restless, hopeful, hungry, quiet.”  
- “Warm mug grounded me; anxiety 7→5.”  
- “Glimmer: leaf shadow moving—2 breaths.”  

That *counts* as journaling.
