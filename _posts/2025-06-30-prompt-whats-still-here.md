Sometimes healing doesn't arrive as a wave of change, but as a quiet reminder of what has stayed.

This week’s journal prompt invites you to shift focus—not to what you’ve lost, but to what has remained.

## Prompt:

**What’s still here?**  
What feelings, people, places, or parts of yourself have remained steady—even through change?

- What have you come back to, again and again?  
- What continues to nourish you quietly in the background?  
- What old parts of you might be waiting patiently to be seen again?

Take a few moments to write. You don’t have to make meaning right away—just notice what’s still here.

You can save or revisit this question whenever you need grounding. What remains is often what matters most.
