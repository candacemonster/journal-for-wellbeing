Sometimes healing doesn’t feel like breakthrough—just the realization that some things *never left.*

Instead of scanning for what’s missing, pause and look at what stayed: the person who still checks in, the trail you keep walking, the small habit that keeps you tethered, the inner voice that didn’t abandon you.

**Prompt:** *“What’s still here?”*

Let it open into gentle sub-questions:

- What (or who) do I keep returning to without forcing it?  
- What continues to nourish me quietly in the background?  
- Which parts of me went dim but have not actually disappeared?  
- What anchors held when everything else shifted?  

List without polishing. Objects, names, sensations, routines, words. If meaning tries to rush in, let it, but you don’t owe an interpretation today. Inventory first. Meaning can arrive later.

If you feel tempted to judge the list as “not enough,” breathe and add one more small, ordinary thing (the mug that’s always beside you, the dog’s steady presence, the way morning light still finds the same corner).

This is a grounding practice: locating continuity. What remains is often what matters.

If beginning at all feels hard, the reminder to simply start is [here](/start-where-you-are/). If you want to keep it to a few honest lines, that note lives [here](/a-few-lines-a-day/).

Close the notebook when you feel a little more *with* yourself. Return to this prompt whenever you feel emptied out. There is usually more still here than the anxious mind reports.
