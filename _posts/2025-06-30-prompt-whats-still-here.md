Healing isn’t always dramatic. Sometimes it’s as quiet as realizing: *this never left.*

Rather than scanning for what’s missing, pause to notice what remained:
- The person who still checks in  
- The path you keep walking  
- A phrase you always return to  
- An inner voice that stayed present, even when dim

### Prompt: *What’s still here?*

Let the question expand gently:

- Who or what do I return to without forcing it?  
- What continues to nourish me in small, background ways?  
- Which parts of me faded but never disappeared?  
- What has anchored me through change?

Write a list—no need to explain or organize. Include names, objects, sensations, routines. Let the simple act of inventory be enough.

If judgment shows up (“this isn’t deep enough”), breathe. Add one more ordinary thing: a chipped mug, a patch of sun, the dog who always waits. Healing often hides in the consistent.

This is a practice in locating continuity. What remains might be what matters most.

### Gentle Follow-Ups

- For a soft way to begin: [Start Where You Are](/start-where-you-are/)  
- To keep entries tiny and doable: [A Few Lines a Day](/a-few-lines-a-day/)

Close the notebook when you feel a little more *with* yourself. Return to this prompt anytime you feel unmoored. There's usually more still here than the anxious mind reports.
