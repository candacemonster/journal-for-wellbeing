There’s a quiet magic in noticing.

Noticing how your shoulders rise toward your ears when you're stressed. How the light changes through the window as the day wears on. How certain memories return when you're least expecting them.

Journaling doesn’t have to begin with pages of structured thoughts. It can begin simply — with noticing.

## Try this:

- Sit for just a minute. What sounds do you hear?  
- What are your feet touching?  
- What feels most tender in your heart right now?

Now open your notebook or voice recorder. Just write or speak the answers. You don’t need transitions or conclusions. You’re simply collecting impressions, like placing feathers in a bowl.

Noticing is the beginning of self-connection. It’s not dramatic or performative. But over time, it creates a gentle record of presence.

And sometimes, that’s exactly what we need.
