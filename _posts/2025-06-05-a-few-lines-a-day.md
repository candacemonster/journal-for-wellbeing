What happens in your brain when you journal?

Studies have shown that expressive writing activates the brain’s **prefrontal cortex** — the part associated with decision-making, emotional regulation, and self-awareness.

In other words: putting feelings into words helps your brain make sense of them.

The benefits don’t require perfect grammar or long entries. Even a few honest lines can begin to shift your nervous system into a calmer state.

Journaling can also:

+ Reduce rumination and stress  
+ Improve sleep and focus  
+ Increase resilience after trauma  
+ Strengthen memory and learning  

And over time, it creates something even deeper: a steady, trusting relationship with your inner self.

You begin to believe: *I can meet myself. I can handle what’s here.*

That’s powerful.

So if you’ve been feeling scattered or heavy lately, start small.

A few lines. Each day. With kindness.

That’s enough to begin changing your brain — and your life.
