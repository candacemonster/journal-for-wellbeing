You don’t have to write **pages** to help your brain.  
A few sincere lines—scattered and unpolished—can begin the real work.

**Why is this enough?**  
When you translate a feeling into words, your brain’s thinking regions (prefrontal cortex) help modulate emotional surges (the “limbic” system).  
The act of naming *softens the raw edge:*  
> Writing “I feel tight and overwhelmed” puts chaos into language.  
> Language is smaller than chaos—easier to meet, easier to hold.

### Science in Brief

- **Ease Rumination:** Jotting down looping thoughts gives them a place to land, quieting mental noise.
- **Lower Stress:** Research (see Dr. Matthew Lieberman’s “affect labeling”) shows naming emotions reduces stress arousal.
- **Better Sleep:** Mind dumps before bed can lessen late-night cognitive churn.
- **Memory & Learning:** Revisiting daily life in writing strengthens memory and helps you notice patterns.

But often, the most profound shift is relational:  
> *I keep meeting myself. Nothing gets disowned or lost.*  
That builds self-trust. With repetition, you start to believe:  
> *I can sit with what’s here and not disappear.*  
That belief changes how future stress lands in your body and mind.

### How to Keep It Small

- Write today’s date (or not).
- Name one body sensation.
- Jot one feeling word.
- Add a single sentence beginning:  
  *“I need…”* or *“I notice…”*
- Stop. Close the notebook.

That *counts*—and it’s enough.

### Making It Stick

Scattered? Heavy?  
Start smaller than you think “counts”—three true lines and a dose of kindness.

**Return tomorrow.** The quiet repetition—*not* the volume—lays the new neural pathways of calm and clarity. (See: Dr. James Pennebaker’s research on expressive writing for stress and emotional health.)

A few lines a day.  
That’s enough to start changing your brain—and the tone of your inner life.
