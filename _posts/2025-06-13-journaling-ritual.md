You don’t need a dedicated room or a new journal to begin. But having a few gentle rituals can help make journaling something you look forward to — and return to.

Here are a few ways to begin creating your own journaling ritual:

## 1. Choose your time

Maybe it’s five minutes in the morning before anyone else wakes up. Or the quiet stretch after dinner. Let it be a pocket of stillness that feels yours.

## 2. Create sensory cues

Light a candle. Pour tea. Play a certain song. These small choices tell your body: _we’re entering a safe space now._

## 3. Keep your tools simple

A pen that glides, a notebook that feels good in your hands. Or your phone's voice memo app on airplane mode. Whatever helps you show up without pressure.

## 4. Don’t force meaning

Some days it’ll feel profound. Some days, mundane. Either way — you showed up. You turned inward instead of away.

That’s the real ritual: making space for yourself. Again and again.
