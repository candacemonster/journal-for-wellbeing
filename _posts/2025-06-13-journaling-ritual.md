You don’t need a perfect nook or matching stationery.  
A ritual is just a few repeated cues that tell your nervous system: *we can soften here.*

Think **tiny**:

Choose a pocket of time that already exists—a first quiet five minutes, the pause after dinner, the moment you get back into bed.  
Consistency beats length.

Add one sensory cue.  
Light a small candle.  
Warm mug in your hands.  
A single instrumental track on low.  

These cues become a felt bridge: *we drop inside now.*

Keep tools frictionless:  
A pen that moves.  
A notebook you’re not saving for “better.”  
Or a plain text file.  

(Still convincing yourself to begin? That reminder lives [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/start-where-you-are/).  
Want to keep it tiny? A note on that is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/a-few-lines-a-day/).)

Begin with what’s present:  
One sensation (*“jaw tight”*).  
One emotion word.  
One sentence starting with *“I notice…”*  
Stop there if you like.

Showing up **is** the ritual—not producing something profound.

Some sessions will feel flat; some will open a door. Neither is failure.  
The repetition is what trains the body to associate the page with regulation, breath, presence.

A candle. A cup. Three lines. Close the notebook.

That’s a ritual.

Return tomorrow. It will be waiting in the same small shape—ready to hold you again.
